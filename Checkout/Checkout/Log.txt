1. Created ASP.NET Project on Visual Studio 15 Enterprise
2. Used MVC template, and created unit tests and Git directory
3. Created Services project and added it to the solution.
4. Created Entities project and added it to the solution.
5. Added reference to the Service project to the main Web project.
6. Added Item class in Entities project. Represents the main store item object.
7. Added ICheckout interface to Services. Represents the main Checkout service.
8. Added Moq mocking library through Nuget. Moq will mock the ICheckout service in the HomeControllerTest unit test class
9. Added references to the Services and Entities projects to the Test project.
10. The TestCleanup method, runs after each unit test and verifies any mock contact service setup.
11. HomeController now needs a constructor that takes a ICheckout service instance.
12. Index_ExpectViewResultReturned method in the HomeControllerTest class implemented.
13. Mock out a call to a GetAllItems method on the mock checkout service, which should return a bunch of stubItems.
14. Create the expected viewmodel from the stub items.
15. Call the Index action on the controller.
16. Get the view model created from the Index action and casting it as a List<ItemViewModel>.
17. Last thing to do, is to loop over the expected item view models and assert that the actual view models are the same.
